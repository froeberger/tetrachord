# tetrachord
MUSIC MAKING: This software utilizes the Wolfram Language to make custom scales & tunings out of a pair of tetrachords ( the 593 non-equal-temperament tetrachords catalogued in John Chalmer's seminal work on the topic: 'Divisions of the Tetrachord' ) in the tonic frequency of your choice.
 
 
Hear your custom scale as an audio file preview, generate a Scala tuning file (.scl) for tuning your scale in the software synthesizer or Digital Audio Workstation of your choice, and graph the epimoricity of the scale.  For free, from a musician to my fellow musicians, and from a good heart. 


FILES: 

tetrachordian[incremental version number].nb = the full-blown Wolfram Language notebook intended for use within Wolfram Mathematica, Wolfram Desktop, or Wolfram One.  Compatibility with Wolfram Player or Wolfram CDF Player remains untested and uncertain.  


octavian[incremental version number].nb = a version of tetrachordian intended for use within the Wolfram Cloud.


Enjoy!
